GPGMail 2.5b4 - Release Notes
============================

Features
--------

### Intuitive security indicator for encrypted mails

* Until now we showed an open lock to indicate that the mail has been decrypted. But actually there are only two states: successful decryption (which now shows a closed lock) or no decryption at all due to an error (which results in an error message). We think the new behavior is more intuitive to grasp. The open lock for decrypted messages was irritation and worried quite a few users. [#777]

Bugfixes
--------

*  Assertion failure when using legary PGP inline mode: Creating inline PGP message works again as expected. [#788]
*  Drafts were not saved if the signing key information was not available when saving a draft. [#791]
*  Correctly detect inline PGP in text/html messages. [#787]
